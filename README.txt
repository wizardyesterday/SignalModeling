This is the start of a collection of statistical digital signal processing
building blocks.  There is a book entitled "Statistical Digital Signal
Processing and Modeling" by Monson Hayes.  Now, there is alot of Matlab
code in the book, but since I choose to use Scilab rather than Matlab
(go open source!), I am converting the Matlab code to Scilab so that others
that use Scilab can take advantage of my work.

If you look at the website for the Matlab code (search for statistical
digital signal processing and modeling mfiles), you'll notice a directory
structure for each directory contains a collection of mfiles. I chose to
place translations of those mfiles into a single Scilab file for each
directory (the exception is my core file: utils.sci).

My first (in progress) file is SignalModeling.sci.

There will be more things to come...
